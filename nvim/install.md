cd ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/ControlEscape.spoon

script/setup
```

works!

but I want home row mods and layers too

## windows

https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_Windows
the "fwompner" option, saved in scripts/

compile to exe
add link to startup dir

but I want home row mods and layers too

## home row mods

https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods

Replace CAPS with ESC and CTRL too

And add a layer for symbols with the space bar

### macos

#### karabiner

https://github.com/Erlendms/karabiner-actions?tab=readme-ov-file#home-row-mods

weird behaviour with combination of keys. You have to press them all at once to register.

#### kmonad

https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/doc/installation.md#macos
dext already installed by karabiner elements
build against dext
Make sure that iokit-name matches keyboard name in macos, eg "CK530"

sudo kmonad -l debug home_row_mods_macos.kbd

TODO get running on startup
launcd?

### win

kmonad
download binary
https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/releases
copy kbd file to kmonad dir
add shortcut to kmonad binary calling with kbd file
eg ...\Documents\kmonad\kmonad-0.4.1-win.exe ...\Documents\kmonad\home_row_mods_win.kbd
add shortcut to dir given by win+r shell:startup

This does CAPS to ESC as well, but no CTRL
